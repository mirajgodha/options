## Option Strategies

### Long Call Condor

Long Call Condor is a strategy that must be devised when the  __investor is neutral on the market direction and expects volatility to be less in the market.__

A Long Call Condor strategy is formed by buying Out-of-the-Money Call Option (lower strike), buying In- the-Money Call Option (lower strike), selling Out-of-the-Money Call Option (higher middle) and selling In- the-Money Call Option (higher middle). All Call Options must have the same underlying security and expiration month.

This strategy is very similar to a Long Call Butterfly. The difference is that the sold options have different strikes. The profit pay off profile is wider than that of the Long Butterfly.

Investor view: Neutral on direction and bearish on Stock/ Index volatility.

**Risk:** Limited.

**Reward:** Limited.

**Lower breakeven:** Lowest Strike + net premium paid. 

**Higher breakeven:** Highest Strike â€“ net premium paid.
